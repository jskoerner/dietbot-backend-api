Dietary iron is indeed known to be poorly absorbed from food sources. While the richest sources of iron include red meat and organ meats, as well as whole grains, shellfish, nuts, and dried fruits, the absorption efficiency can vary significantly. Factors like the form of iron (heme vs. non-heme) influence absorption rates, with heme iron from animal sources being more readily absorbed than non-heme iron from plant sources. Furthermore, the absorption of iron can be enhanced by the presence of Vitamin C, which is often added to iron supplements, thus improving the body's capacity to take in this vital mineral.\",\n          \"Identified intent: Meal-Planning-Recipes. Based on the nutritional sources identified, here are three high-protein vegetarian snack options that incorporate plant-based proteins, suitable for a vegetarian diet: 1. **Edamame**: This young soybean is rich in protein and can be enjoyed steamed and lightly salted. It offers approximately 18 grams of protein per cup. 2. **Cottage Cheese with Berries**: A protein-rich dairy option, cottage cheese has about 28 grams of protein per cup. Pairing it with berries gives a nutritious, high-protein snack that combines protein with antioxidants. 3. **Chickpea Hummus with Veggie Sticks**: Made from blended chickpeas, hummus is a high-protein dip that provides around 8 grams of protein per 100 grams. Serve it with carrot, cucumber, or bell pepper sticks for a healthy, crunchy snack.\",\n          \"Identified intent: Educational-Content. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin D varies based on various factors including age, health status, and exposure to sunlight. For most adults, an intake of 400 IU (international units) of vitamin D per day is considered safe and adequate for maintaining bone health and overall wellness. However, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized recommendations, especially for higher doses or specific health conditions.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"context_used\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Knowledge Source (score: 0.66): Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers76Vitamin/Mineral Source RDAaIts function in the body Fluoride (F)Seafood, tea, coffee and soybeans; sodium fluoride is often added to the water supply to prevent tooth decay.None Promotes bone and tooth formation; prevents tooth decay.

Body building foods \\u201cGROW\\u201d (proteins) The best sources among these foods are animal foods i.e., milks, meats, fish, eggs, poultry. However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits. Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants. This lowers the cost of feeding but maintains the quality. Milk is both a protective food and a body building food. Thus, as much as possible, it must be put in place for families to access it.
